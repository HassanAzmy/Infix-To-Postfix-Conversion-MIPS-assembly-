# Infix to Prefix Expression Converter in MIPS Assembly
## Description
This project implements an Infix to Prefix Expression Converter using the MIPS assembly language. It utilizes stack-based operations to handle operator precedence, associativity, and the complexities of mathematical expressions, including support for negative numbers, multi-digit operands, and various operators.
The project demonstrates efficient memory management and showcases low-level programming concepts in MIPS assembly.

## Features
- Infix to Prefix Conversion: Converts infix expressions into prefix notation.
- Operator Precedence & Associativity: Correctly handles the order of operations for various operators.
- Negative Numbers: Supports negative numbers seamlessly within expressions.
- Multi-Digit Operands: Processes operands of any size (single- and multi-digit).
- Stack-Based Implementation: Efficient use of stack data structure for expression evaluation.
